# Sitemap Builder

A sitemap is basically a map of all of the pages within a specific domain. They are used by search engines and other tools to inform them of all of the pages on your domain.

One way these can be built is by first visiting the root page of the website and making a list of every link on that page that goes to a page on the same domain. For instance, on `google.com` you might find a link to `google.com/search/` along with several other links.

Once you have created the list of links, you could then visit each and add any new links to your list. By repeating this step over and over you would eventually visit every page that on the domain that can be reached by following links from the root page.

sitemap builder outputs the data in the following XML format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.com/dogs</loc>
  </url>
</urlset>
```
